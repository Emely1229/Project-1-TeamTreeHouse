        <p>International Dancers Association, also known as IDA is a group of individuals who all share the same passion and love for dance. Those in IDA come
        from all over the world using Virtual Reality to dance together. Through Virtual Reality IDA is able to host dance lessons for beginner dancers as well as
        hold dance workshops. IDA started by a group of friends who wanted to share their love of dancing within the small VR community at the same. Over time as
        new people join Virtual Reality, IDA has been growing and sharing their love of dance with all those in the community.</p>

        <p> Through Virtual Reality IDA is able to create dance groups within the community and hone their techniques by attending virtual workshops and lessons. Many seasoned
        dancers in IDA hold workshops so that new recruits can gain the skills and experience they seek out without having to step outside. A user can simply put on their virtual
        reality gear and step into their dance lessons. IDA is known for their dance cyphers in which users form a circle so that dancers can step inside to challenge other dancers
        and gain experience in a competitive dance style. Despite their love of competition the community within IDA is full of love and spread their dancing skills to all who seek
        it through the use of Virtual Reality. </p>
