        <h2 class="tag-name">Virtual Reality</h2>
        <p>Virtual Reality has been around for a while now but is still in its early adoption stage. Virtual Reality allows a user to escape reality into a world of fantasy which can include flying dragons or something as simple as a quiet cafe. Recently I have been consumed by Virtual Reality and all of the things it offers like long-distance friendships, the ability to dance with a person on the opposite side of the world, and the ability to create opportunities.</p>

        <p>On my free time I enjoy to hop into virtual reality and dance alongside my fellow friends in the international dance association. This IDA, <a href="ida.html">international dance association</a> is only possible because of Virtual Reality in which our friends in Korea, New York and California can all come together and have a dance cypher and compete. Virtual Reality allows users to not only be immersed sight wise into VR but also through body movements. Trackers are a new development which allows
      a user to track their body movements inside of VR.</p>

        <h2 class="tag-name">Dance and Music</h2>
        <p>I enjoy to dance and listen to music within Virtual Reality as well as in real life. Dancing allows me to release tension and express myself. Music is a part of my everyday life from music to wind down before bed to music to keep a positive atmosphere when waking up. </p>

        <p>I like to learn new dance moves within shuffling and listen to electronic dance music. Music and dance allow me to keep a positive mindset through everyday tasks and life.</p>
       <p>Being able to express feelings through dance is an amazing feeling that allows a person to embrace their emotions. It is a great way to release tension and stress and has been a lifesaver in my day to day life. Any feeling of negative emotion can be taken away by music and dance for myself. I have been dancing since a child starting with spanish folk songs to electronic music now as an adult.
       Over the years I have learned different types of dance types including:</p>
