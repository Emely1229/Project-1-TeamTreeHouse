        <h2 class="tag-name">Virtual Reality</h2>
        <p>Virtual Reality has been around for a while now but is still in its early adoption stage. Virtual Reality allows a user to escape reality into a world of fantasy which can include flying dragons or something as simple as a quiet cafe. Recently I have been consumed by Virtual Reality and all of the things it offers like long-distance friendships, the ability to dance with a person on the opposite side of the world, and the ability to create opportunities.</p>

        <p>On my free time I enjoy to hop into virtual reality and dance alongside my fellow friends in the international dance association. This IDA, international dance association is only possible because of Virtual Reality in which our friends in Korea, New York and California can all come together and have a dance cypher and compete. Virtual Reality allows users to not only be immersed sight wise into VR but also through body movements. Trackers are a new development which allows
      a user to track their body movements inside of VR.</p>

        <p>I will hone the skills I have gained in building web sites and continue to add onto them as time permits new changes. I will master the languages of:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the future I would like to work for a company that I support the moral values of and where I can make new, innovating and asthetic web design for.</p>
